# Contrary to [, [[ prevents word splitting of variable values.
# So, if VAR="var with spaces",you do not need to double quote $VAR
# in a test - eventhough using quotes remains a good habit.
# Also, [[ prevents pathname expansion,
# so literal strings with wildcards do not try to expand to filenames
# Using [[, == and != interpret strings to the right
# as shell glob patterns to be matched against the value to the left,
# for instance: [[ "value" == val* ]].
