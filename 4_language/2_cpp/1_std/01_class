1 What is condition for the defualt constructor is a trivial or non-trivial?
  target: defualt constructor
  property: trivial
  1.1 A defualt constructor is not user-provided
  1.2 its class has no virtual functions and no virtual base classes
  1.3 no non-static data member of its class has a default member initializer
  1.4 all the direct base classes of its class have trivial default constructors.
  1.5 for all the non-static data members of its class that are of class type (or arry thereof), each such class has a trivial default constructor.

2 What is condition for destructor is trivial or non-trivial?
  target: destructor
  property: trivial
  2.1 a destructor is not user-provided
  2.2 the destructor is not virtual
  2.3 all of the direct base classes of its class have trivial destructors
  2.4 for all of the non-static data members of its class that are of class type (or array thereof), each such class has a trivial desturctor

3 What is condition for trivial or non-trivial of copy/move constructor ?
  target: copy/move constructor
  property: trivial
  3.1 a copy/move constructor for class X is trivial if it is not user-provided
  3.2 class X has no virtual function and no virtual base classes
  3.3 The constructor selected to copy/move each direct base class subobject is trivial
  3.4 for each non-static data member of X that is of class type (or array thereof), the constructor selected to copy/move that member is trivial
